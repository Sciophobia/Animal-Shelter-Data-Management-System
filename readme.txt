Brief Description
----------------------------
This application is an animal records system for Furry Friends Animal Shelter.
It provides an intuitive interface that allows staff to enter information regarding
each animal and allows them to print various types of reports which are based on the
information entered. The various reports are listed:
1) Client Report: This report is given to clients upon adoption of an animal. The information
contained in this report is brief but necessary for adopters. 
2) Inventory Report: This report lists each animal residing at the shelter and their cage number.
3) Cost Report: This report contains a detailed list of expenses for any animal at the shelter.
4) Expense Report: This report contains a list of all of the animals and their total expenses at the
shelter.
5) Case Number Information: This "report" is the most detailed, as it contains all of the information added 
by a staff member. This is the screen where the staff members can view animal-specific reports.
6) Animal Case Numbers: This contains a list of all of the animals at the shelter and their corresponding
case numbers.
As well as an intuitive design, the application offers save and open options. All information entered in the program
is saved, if opted.
